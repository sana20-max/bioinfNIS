# bioinfNIS
Repository for the Bioinformatics course, in this case, NIS-based extracurricular activity for school students.

Hello everyone! 
My name is Askhat Altaevich Aubakirov, and I will be happy to see you enrolled at this NIS-based Bioinformatics extracurricular activity.

IMPORTANT INFO:
The course is designed for the most prominent students of grades 9-10, but students of grades 11-12 are welcome too! That would be great for you to have some experience with Python - if you don't have it, though, we'll get it anyway.

Всем привет!
Меня зовут Асхат Алтаевич Аубакиров, и я буду рад видеть Вас в НИШ на кружке, посвященном Биоинформатике.
